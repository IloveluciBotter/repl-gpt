1) Deposit → stake balance must be truly real on-chain

You’re “deposit-first,” so this has to be bulletproof:

On-chain deposit verification is correct for your exact HIVE token program (Token-2022 vs SPL Token).

Idempotency: same txSignature can’t credit twice (unique constraint).

Handles edge cases: wrong mint, wrong destination, partial transfer, unconfirmed tx.

A clear UX if deposit is pending/failed (not “nothing happened”).

2) Spend/refund settlement must be atomic

Per attempt you’re doing: reserve fee → auto-review → settle cost/refund → route losses to rewards.
To be “fully functional,” this needs:

No double-settlement (can’t settle same attempt twice).

Atomic DB transaction: stake updates + rewards pool updates + ledger + attempt status all commit together.

Safe behavior if the server crashes mid-flow (resume or roll back cleanly).

3) Rewards wallet flow needs a real sweep plan

You said losses go to a rewards wallet. To finish that feature:

Decide the operational mode:

Accounting-only (just track pending rewards) ✅ simplest

On-chain sweep (periodic transfer from vault → rewards wallet)

If on-chain sweep:

where the vault private key lives (KMS/HSM/secure env) and who can trigger sweep

rate limits + audit logs on sweep

“minimum sweep amount” thresholds

4) Auto-review + human review handoff

Auto-review is working, but “fully functional” means:

AUTO_REVIEW_MODE switch (auto / shadow / off)

A clean way to resolve all those Pending attempts later (admin/reviewer queue)

“One vote per reviewer” + 2-of-3 consensus ready to turn on without refactoring

5) RAG needs a reliable “approve → embed” pipeline

RAG is integrated, but it’s only truly functional if:

Approving corpus always triggers chunking + embedding (and retries on failure)

Embeddings are kept in sync when an item is edited (re-embed + replace old chunks)

A way to see “Approved but not embedded yet” in admin UI (so you can fix stuck items)

Chat returns sources consistently and doesn’t silently answer ungrounded unless you explicitly allow it

6) Cycles/changelog if you want it “official”

If Cycles isn’t implemented yet, that’s the biggest “missing” product feature for legitimacy:

weekly cycle rollover

corpus snapshot + stats snapshot

public changelog page

7) Legal/trust pages + support path

To feel “real” to users (and exchanges/partners later):

Terms, Privacy, Risk disclaimers, Contact/support
