Build the real HiveMind frontend UI to match the existing app features (NOT a placeholder). The backend is already running on port 5000. The error indicates the repo expects a Vite/React client at /client/index.html, so create/restore that client and make it match the HiveMind app.

Non-negotiables:
- Dark theme across the app.
- Back button on all pages.
- Routes/pages must exist and match:
  - /  (Train game / quiz)
  - /chat (Official AI Chat)
  - /corpus (public viewer + search)
  - /corpus/admin (creator-only management UI)
- Must show Intelligence Level display globally (top bar).
- Must show Wallet status globally (connect/disconnect).
- Must enforce token gate: require 50+ HIVE to access gated features (at minimum: Train + Chat; Corpus read can stay public, Admin requires creator).
- Must support auth via wallet signature (JWT or similar) using the existing server/auth implementation.
- Must show chat history UI using existing DB endpoints if present.
- Cosmetics page can exist as “partial/placeholder” but keep the UI consistent.

CRITICAL FIRST STEP (before coding):
1) Inspect the codebase to discover the real API routes and expected payloads.
   - Scan server/index.ts and server routes files for endpoints under /api (auth, chat, corpus, token gate, wallet balance).
   - Identify which endpoints exist for:
     - getting nonce/challenge
     - verifying signature / issuing token
     - checking HIVE balance
     - chat request/response
     - corpus list/search
     - admin corpus CRUD
     - chat history read/write
2) Based on discovered routes, create a small typed client wrapper in the frontend to call these endpoints.
3) Do NOT guess endpoint names; use what exists in the server.

Frontend structure to create (if missing):
- client/index.html
- client/src/main.tsx
- client/src/App.tsx
- client/src/index.css (or tailwind)
- client/src/pages/*
- client/src/components/*

UI Layout spec (match the app):
- Top bar:
  - App name: HiveMind
  - Intelligence Level indicator (pull from server/user profile if exists; otherwise store in local state for now but keep the UI slot)
  - Wallet connect button (Phantom)
  - Token gate status: “HIVE balance: X (Needs 50+)”
  - Back button
- Left nav or top nav:
  - Train, Chat, Corpus, Admin, (optional Cosmetics)
- Page designs:
  - Train (/): quiz game with multiple-choice questions, shows level progression + intelligence impact; locked behind token gate.
  - Chat (/chat): official AI chat UI; calls the real chat endpoint; show streaming if supported; show chat history sidebar if endpoint exists.
  - Corpus (/corpus): public read view; search box calling real corpus search endpoint; show results cards.
  - Corpus Admin (/corpus/admin): creator-only; show table/list + create/edit/delete if endpoints exist; otherwise scaffold with “Endpoint missing” messaging.
- Error handling:
  - If not authenticated, show “Connect wallet to continue” and a button to sign-in.
  - If authenticated but balance < 50, show “Token Gate: need 50+ HIVE” and disable gated actions.

Implementation constraints:
- Use existing dependencies already in package.json if possible.
- If frontend deps are missing, add the minimum: react, react-dom, wouter (or existing router), and whatever Solana wallet library is already used in this repo (prefer existing Phantom integration code).
- Keep code TypeScript.
- Do not change backend route behavior; only wire frontend to it.
- Ensure the Vite dev middleware works: client/index.html must exist so server/vite.ts stops throwing ENOENT.

Deliverable:
- After implementation, app should load on port 5000 without ENOENT.
- Navigating /, /chat, /corpus, /corpus/admin shows matching dark UI with wallet + intelligence bar.
- Token-gated actions are blocked until wallet connected + HIVE >= 50.

After coding:
- Print a short checklist of which endpoints were found and which UI parts are fully wired vs scaffolded.
