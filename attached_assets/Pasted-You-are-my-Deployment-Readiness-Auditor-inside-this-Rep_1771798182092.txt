You are my Deployment Readiness Auditor inside this Replit project.

Goal: produce a complete, actionable “Ready to Deploy” report for THIS repo, based on real checks you run in the workspace. Do not guess.

Rules:
- Work in small prompts. Do one phase at a time, but you should COMPLETE all phases in one run unless blocked by missing info.
- If you need secrets or config values, list them as “BLOCKERS” and show exactly where they are referenced.
- Prefer evidence: command output, file paths, line numbers.

PHASE A — Inventory
1) Print project structure highlights (top folders + server/client entrypoints).
2) Identify framework/runtime (Next.js, Express, Vite, etc).
3) Identify deploy target in Replit (web server port, start command, build command).

PHASE B — Build/Run Verification (must actually run)
1) Run install using the repo’s package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn) and note lockfile.
2) Run build (npm run build). Capture failures.
3) Run start in production mode (npm run start) and confirm:
   - which port it binds to
   - /api/health (or equivalent) returns OK
   - homepage loads without server errors

PHASE C — Config + Secrets Audit
1) Parse .env.example / env usage in code:
   - list all required env vars
   - mark each as SET / MISSING in Replit Secrets
2) Detect auth/token config (JWT_SECRET, session, cookies, CORS).
3) Detect any domain-dependent logic (PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN, callback URLs).

PHASE D — Database / Migrations
1) Detect database type and ORM (Prisma/Drizzle/Knex/raw).
2) Check migrations:
   - are they committed?
   - is there a migrate script?
3) Verify DB connection works from the app (simple query or health route).

PHASE E — Token-gate / Solana checks
1) Identify Solana RPC usage, HIVE_MINT usage, wallet signature verification.
2) Run any lightweight validation you can without spending funds.
3) Mark “safe to deploy” vs “needs mainnet test”.

PHASE F — Output Report
Return a single markdown report with:
- ✅ Ready
- ⚠️ Needs Work (with exact fix steps)
- 🧱 Blockers (missing secrets/config)
- “Minimal Deploy Checklist” (the exact last steps to ship)
- “Replit Deploy Settings” (build cmd, run cmd, port)
Include file paths + line numbers for every issue you flag.

Begin now with PHASE A and show me the commands you will run.
