# Train Your AI - Quiz Game

## Overview

A gamified AI training quiz game where users answer multiple-choice questions to make their virtual AI companion smarter or dumber based on performance. The game features an unlimited level progression system, Solana wallet integration with token-gating, and persistent state via localStorage. Built with a modern dark-themed UI inspired by gamified learning apps like Duolingo and Habitica.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom plugins for Replit integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming (dark mode default)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind)
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence for game state
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query for API calls

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Build**: esbuild for production bundling with selective dependency bundling
- **Static Serving**: Express serves Vite-built frontend from `dist/public`
- **Authentication**: Secure nonce-based Solana wallet authentication with server-side sessions
  - Domain-bound message format prevents cross-domain replay attacks
  - Atomic nonce consumption prevents concurrent verification exploits
  - Session tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes in PostgreSQL
  - 7-day session expiry with httpOnly cookies
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint rate limits (IP-based for unauthenticated, wallet-based for authenticated)
  - Auth nonce/verify: 10/min/IP
  - Public read endpoints: 60/min/IP
  - Chat: 30/min/wallet + 60/min/IP
  - Submissions: 60/min/wallet
  - Corpus/review: 20/min/wallet
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs via pino with request IDs, wallet addresses, and IP hashes
- **Audit Logging**: Database table tracking sensitive actions (logins, submissions, reviews, corpus changes, admin actions)
- **Health Monitoring**: `/api/health` aggregated status, `/api/health/ready` for readiness, `/api/health/live` for liveness
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration (optional, requires `SENTRY_DSN`)
- **AI Fallback Control**: `ALLOW_AI_FALLBACK` controls fallback behavior (default: false in production)

### Data Storage
- **Game State**: localStorage for client-side persistence (intelligence level, scores, sessions)
- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (users table defined, ready for expansion)
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` with Zod validation via drizzle-zod

### Key Design Patterns
- **Screen-based Navigation**: Single-page app with show/hide screens (home, training, result)
- **Component Composition**: Game components in `client/src/components/game/`, UI primitives in `client/src/components/ui/`
- **Shared Code**: `shared/` directory for code used by both client and server
- **Path Aliases**: `@/` for client source, `@shared/` for shared code

### Game Mechanics
- **Scoring Rules**: Pass thresholds scale by level (70% for L1-10, 80% for L11-20, 90% for L21+)
- **Unlimited Levels**: Dynamic difficulty scaling with no upper bound on currentLevel or maxUnlockedLevel
- **Question System**: 50 questions with complexity ratings (1-5), selected based on current level
- **Level Selection**: Players can choose any unlocked level (1 to maxUnlockedLevel)
- **AI Chat**: Intelligence-based responses that vary with intelligenceLevel (basic to elite)

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- **Vector Search**: pgvector-enabled database with 768-dimension embeddings using cosine similarity
- **Text Chunking**: 1000 character chunks with 200 character overlap for long corpus items
- **Embedding Service**: Ollama API with gemma3:4b model (configurable via OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL)
- **Source Grounding**: AI chat responses include `isGrounded` flag and `sources` array with similarity scores
- **Approval Workflow**: Corpus items are embedded automatically when approved by admin
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/rag/search` - Vector similarity search with query, k, and optional trackId
  - `POST /api/rag/embed/:id` - Manually embed a corpus item (admin only)
  - `POST /api/corpus/:id/approve` - Approve and auto-embed corpus item (admin only)

### Auto-Review System
- **Perfect Score Rule**: 100% accuracy + 30s+ duration = auto-approve
- **Low Score Rule**: ≤40% accuracy = auto-reject
- **Pending Review**: Scores between 40-100% go to manual review queue
- **Environment Variables**: AUTO_REVIEW_ENABLED (default true), AUTO_REVIEW_MIN_DURATION_SEC (default 30)

### Training Stake Economy
- **Stake System**: Users deposit HIVE tokens to a vault and receive internal stake balance
- **On-Chain Verification**: Deposits are verified via Solana RPC to prevent fraud
  - Validates transaction exists and succeeded
  - Confirms transfer destination is the configured vault
  - Verifies token mint matches HIVE token
  - Ensures sender wallet matches authenticated user
- **Fee Reserve/Settle**: Training fees are reserved upfront and settled based on score
  - Perfect score (100%): 0% cost (full refund)
  - Pass (≥70%): Partial cost scaled by performance
  - Fail (<70%): 100% cost
- **Difficulty Fees**: Fees scale by difficulty (low: 0.5x, medium: 1x, high: 2x, extreme: 4x base fee)
- **Rewards Pool**: Failed training fees route to rewards pool for distribution
- **Database Tables**: wallet_balances, stake_ledger, rewards_pool
- **Environment Variables**:
  - ECON_BASE_FEE_HIVE: Base fee amount (default: 1)
  - ECON_PASS_THRESHOLD: Pass threshold (default: 0.7)
  - ECON_MIN_PARTIAL_COST_PCT: Minimum cost for partial pass (default: 0.2)
  - HIVE_VAULT_ADDRESS: Vault address for deposits
  - HIVE_MINT: HIVE token mint address
  - REWARDS_WALLET_ADDRESS: Address for rewards distribution

### Learning Telemetry Pipeline
- **Answer Events**: Raw training telemetry logged per question answered (expires after retention period)
  - Tracks wallet, attempt, track, question, selected answer, correctness
  - Includes score, duration, level, auto-decision, and cycle number
- **Aggregates**: Rolled up stats computed every 15 minutes (kept forever)
  - question_aggregates: Per-question accuracy, attempt counts, average duration
  - track_aggregates: Per-track accuracy and attempt counts
  - cycle_aggregates: Per-cycle accuracy and attempt counts
- **Retention Cleanup**: Runs every 24 hours, deletes events older than ANSWER_EVENTS_RETENTION_DAYS (default: 60)
- **Stats Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/stats/tracks` - Track-level aggregate stats
  - `GET /api/stats/questions?trackId=...` - Question-level stats optionally filtered by track
  - `GET /api/stats/cycle/current` - Current cycle stats
  - `GET /api/stats/cycles` - All cycle stats
