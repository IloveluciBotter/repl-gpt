You are an expert front-end developer. I already have a working “Train Your AI” game with:

- Home screen showing AI stats and Start Training button
- Training screen that runs a 10-question multiple choice session
- Result screen that applies the 70% / 50% rules to adjust intelligence level and score
- State persisted in localStorage
- Solana wallet integration and token-gated Start button
- A redesigned dark-theme UI card layout
- (Possibly) some previous limited level logic (e.g. Level 1–3)

DO NOT remove or break existing wallet integration, persistence, or scoring rules. Instead:

1. Replace any fixed-level system with an UNLIMITED level ladder that keeps getting harder.
2. Add a chat box on the home screen to talk to the AI, where the reply style depends on intelligenceLevel.

Implement everything fully. No placeholders, no TODOs.

====================================================
PART 1 – UNLIMITED LEVELS WITH SCALING DIFFICULTY
====================================================

Replace any previous Level 1/2/3 setup with the following:

State:

- Add or keep:
  - currentLevel (number)
  - maxUnlockedLevel (number)

Initialization:

- On a brand new save:
  - currentLevel = 1
  - maxUnlockedLevel = 1

Question Bank:

- Define a single QUESTION_BANK array with AT LEAST 30 meaningful questions (more is even better).
- Each question object must include:
  - id (number)
  - text (string, real question text)
  - options (array of at least 3 real options)
  - correctIndex (index into options)
  - complexity (integer 1–5)

Use REAL questions and answers, not placeholders like “Question 1” or “Option A/B/C”. Make complexity mean:

- complexity 1–2: easier questions (basic math, simple general knowledge, obvious definitions)
- complexity 3–4: more involved reasoning, trickier wording, or multi-step logic
- complexity 5: hardest questions, conceptually dense or with subtle traps

Session Question Selection:

- Every session is still exactly 10 questions.
- When a session starts, choose 10 questions from QUESTION_BANK based on currentLevel:

  1. Compute a target difficulty band from currentLevel. For example:
     - Levels 1–3: mostly complexity 1
     - Levels 4–6: complexity 1–2 (bias toward 2)
     - Levels 7–9: complexity 2–3
     - Levels 10–12: complexity 3–4
     - Levels 13 and above: complexity 4–5

  2. Implement this logic in code:
     - For low levels, pick more questions with lower complexity.
     - As currentLevel increases, prefer questions with higher complexity values.
     - If needed, you can still include a few lower complexity questions for variety.
  3. Randomize (shuffle) the questions used in each session so runs are not identical.

Unlimited Levels & Unlocking:

- There is no fixed upper bound on currentLevel or maxUnlockedLevel.
- At the end of each session:
  - If the player’s scorePercent meets the PASS threshold for that currentLevel:
    - If currentLevel === maxUnlockedLevel:
      - Increase maxUnlockedLevel by 1
    - Leave currentLevel unchanged unless the user manually changes it on the home screen.

Pass thresholds by level band:

- Levels 1–10:
  - Pass and “unlock next level” when scorePercent >= 70.
- Levels 11–20:
  - Pass and unlock next level only when scorePercent >= 80.
- Levels 21+:
  - Pass and unlock next level only when scorePercent >= 90.

Fail logic (below 70) still follows the existing rules:

- 50–69%: AI learns nothing (no intelligence change).
- <50%: AI loses intelligence (level down / score penalty already defined).

Home Screen Level Selector UI:

- On the Home screen, add a level selector instead of a limited Level 1/2/3 UI:

  - Show something like: “[ ◀ ] Level X [ ▶ ]”
  - Left arrow decreases currentLevel by 1, but never below 1.
  - Right arrow increases currentLevel by 1, but never above maxUnlockedLevel.
  - Display a small difficulty label under the selector based on currentLevel, e.g.:
    - “Difficulty: Easy” for levels 1–3
    - “Difficulty: Normal” for levels 4–9
    - “Difficulty: Advanced” for levels 10–15
    - “Difficulty: Expert” for levels 16+ (you can tune the ranges).

- Show the currentLevel clearly on both the Home screen and the Training/Result screens, for example:
  - “Training Session – Level 7”
  - “Level: 7 (Advanced)” on the result screen.

Persistence:

- Save currentLevel and maxUnlockedLevel in the same localStorage state as the other game stats.
- On load, restore them and clamp currentLevel to maxUnlockedLevel if needed (in case of state mismatch).

====================================================
PART 2 – AI CHAT BOX (INTELLIGENCE-BASED REPLIES)
====================================================

Add a chat panel on the Home screen to talk to the AI and “feel” its intelligence.

UI:

- Inside the main Home screen card, add a section titled “Chat with Your AI”.
- Components:
  - A scrollable chat area:
    - AI messages aligned to the left.
    - User messages aligned to the right.
  - Above the chat area, show a small label such as:
    - “Current Intelligence: L<intelligenceLevel> • Level <currentLevel>”
  - Below the chat area:
    - A text input (single line) for user messages.
    - A “Send” button.

- Style:
  - Give the chat area a subtle border and slightly different background to separate it from the stats.
  - Ensure it scrolls when many messages are present and always scrolls to the bottom on new messages.

Behavior:

- Maintain an in-memory array of chat messages. No need to persist chat history in localStorage.
- On load, seed the chat with one AI message, for example:
  - A real greeting line like: “Hello, I’m your AI. Train me with high-quality answers and I’ll grow smarter over time.”

On sending a message:

1. When the user types a message and clicks “Send” (or presses Enter):
   - If empty, ignore.
   - Add the user message to the chat as a user bubble.
   - Clear the input field.
2. Generate an AI reply using a function like:

   ```js
   function generateAiReply(userMessage, state) { ... }
