You are an expert front-end developer working on my existing “Train Your AI” game.

The game already has:

- Home screen with AI avatar, stats, level selector, Start Training button, and AI chat
- Training screen with 10-question sessions and difficulty scaling by level
- Result screen that applies:
  - ≥70%: AI learns (intelligence up)
  - 50–69%: no learning
  - <50%: intelligence loss
- Unlimited level system with a QUESTION_BANK of 50 questions and complexity 1–5
- State persisted in localStorage (intelligence level, score, sessions, etc.)
- Solana wallet integration and token-gating (50 $MEME required)
- Dark theme, glassmorphic UI, and working AI chat

DO NOT break or remove any existing functionality. Only extend the app with:

1) A cosmetic-only currency called `Style Credits`
2) A Cosmetics Shop UI
3) The ability to buy and equip cosmetics
4) 3 avatar skins and 3 aura styles that actually change the visuals

Everything must be fully implemented. No placeholders or TODOs.

====================================================
PART 1 – STYLE CREDITS (COSMETIC CURRENCY)
====================================================

Add a new cosmetic-only currency:

- Name: Style Credits
- Internal state property: `styleCredits` (number)

Behavior:

- Initialize `styleCredits` for brand-new players:
  - Default starting balance: 200 (so the player can buy at least one cosmetic immediately)
- Save `styleCredits` to localStorage as part of the same state object you already use for intelligence, sessions, etc.
- Load `styleCredits` from localStorage on startup.
- Show the Style Credits balance on the Home screen:
  - Under or near the existing stats, display: `Style Credits: <value>`

Earning Style Credits:

For now, implement a simple earning rule tied to ranked sessions:

- After a training session (on the result screen), award Style Credits based on performance:
  - If scorePercent >= 90:
    - +20 Style Credits
  - Else if scorePercent >= 70:
    - +10 Style Credits
  - Else:
    - +0 Style Credits

On the result screen, in the session summary, also show:

- “Style Credits earned this run: +X” (X may be 0, 10, or 20)
- “New Style Credits balance: <updated value>”

====================================================
PART 2 – COSMETIC TYPES (3 SKINS + 3 AURAS)
====================================================

Implement two cosmetic types:

- Avatar Skins (3 total)
- Auras (3 total)

All of these MUST be real, visually different options, not placeholders.

Use the existing AI avatar area on the Home screen and extend it so that it:

- Uses the currently equipped avatar skin to determine:
  - Which emoji/icon is shown
  - Any extra class applied for styling
- Uses the currently equipped aura to determine:
  - The glow color / effect around the avatar container (CSS class-based)

Define these 3 avatar skins:

1) Default Core
   - ID: "skin_default"
   - Name: "Default Core"
   - Description: “Standard training shell.”
   - Visual: keep the current behavior that changes emoji by intelligenceLevel (the existing 🤖💤 / 🤖📚 / 🤖🚀 logic).
   - Price: 0 Style Credits (always owned and always available).

2) Glitched Core
   - ID: "skin_glitched"
   - Name: "Glitched Core"
   - Description: “A core flickering with unstable data.”
   - Visual: use a glitchy-looking emoji or combination, e.g. 🧠💥 or 🤖 with a glitch-style CSS effect (e.g. slight animation, chromatic aberration-style borders).
   - Price: 100 Style Credits.

3) Overclocked Core
   - ID: "skin_overclocked"
   - Name: "Overclocked Core"
   - Description: “Running dangerously close to thermal limits.”
   - Visual: use a fiery or intense emoji combination, e.g. 🤖🔥 or 🔥🤖, and give the avatar a more intense CSS effect (stronger glow).
   - Price: 200 Style Credits.

Define these 3 aura styles:

1) Neon Blue Aura
   - ID: "aura_blue"
   - Name: "Neon Blue Aura"
   - Description: “Cool, stable neural glow.”
   - Visual: blue outer glow around avatar container.
   - Price: 50 Style Credits.

2) Neon Purple Aura
   - ID: "aura_purple"
   - Name: "Neon Purple Aura"
   - Description: “Mysterious experimental field.”
   - Visual: purple outer glow around avatar container.
   - Price: 75 Style Credits.

3) Neon Green Aura
   - ID: "aura_green"
   - Name: "Neon Green Aura"
   - Description: “Overloaded optimization circuits.”
   - Visual: green outer glow around avatar container.
   - Price: 100 Style Credits.

Technical implementation notes:

- Add state fields:
  - `ownedSkins`: array of skin IDs
  - `ownedAuras`: array of aura IDs
  - `equippedSkin`: one skin ID
  - `equippedAura`: one aura ID

- Default ownership:
  - `ownedSkins` should initially include `"skin_default"`
  - `ownedAuras` can start empty (no aura equipped) or you can give Neon Blue Aura for free if you want, but implement prices as described.
- Default equipped:
  - `equippedSkin = "skin_default"` by default.
  - `equippedAura = null` or `"aura_blue"` if you decide to make it free.

Persist `ownedSkins`, `ownedAuras`, `equippedSkin`, and `equippedAura` to localStorage.

====================================================
PART 3 – COSMETICS SHOP UI
====================================================

Add a new “Cosmetics” section accessible from the Home screen.

UI placement:

- On the Home screen card, near the bottom or in a small header area, add a button or tab:
  - Label: “Cosmetics”
- Clicking “Cosmetics” should switch the main card content to a Cosmetics Shop view.
- Provide a way to go back to the main Home / Stats view (e.g. a “Back” button or toggle tabs like “Overview | Cosmetics”).

Cosmetics Shop layout:

- At the top of the shop view, show:
  - Title: “Cosmetics Shop”
  - Current Style Credits balance: “Style Credits: <value>”

- Below, show two sections:
  1) Avatar Skins
  2) Auras

For each section:

- Render cards for each cosmetic with:
  - Name
  - Short description
  - Preview:
    - For skins: show the emoji / representation.
    - For auras: show a small circle or avatar preview with the aura color.
  - Price in Style Credits.
  - Ownership / equip state:

Button behaviors per item:

- If not owned:
  - Show button: “Buy – X Style Credits”
  - Enabled only if styleCredits >= price.
  - On click:
    - Deduct the price from styleCredits.
    - Add the ID to `ownedSkins` or `ownedAuras`.
    - Update localStorage.
    - Refresh UI so it now shows as owned.

- If owned but not equipped:
  - Show button: “Equip”
  - On click:
    - Set `equippedSkin` or `equippedAura` to that item’s ID.
    - Save to localStorage.
    - Immediately update the avatar display on the Home screen to reflect the equipped choice.

- If owned and currently equipped:
  - Show a disabled button or label: “Equipped”.

Ensure that the shop and equipped state are fully functional with real state changes and persistence.

====================================================
PART 4 – APPLYING COSMETICS TO UI
====================================================

Update the existing AI avatar display logic on the Home screen:

1) Skins:

- If `equippedSkin === "skin_default"`:
  - Use the existing logic: emoji changes based on intelligenceLevel (🤖💤 / 🤖📚 / 🤖🚀) and the current caption (“Very basic model”, “Learning well”, “Highly trained”).
- If `equippedSkin === "skin_glitched"`:
  - Always use the chosen “Glitched Core” emoji/visual (e.g. 🧠💥 or similar).
  - Add a CSS class to the avatar container, e.g. `.skin-glitched`, that applies a subtle glitch-style effect (like small shifts, borders, or animation).
- If `equippedSkin === "skin_overclocked"`:
  - Use the “Overclocked Core” emoji/visual (e.g. 🤖🔥).
  - Add `.skin-overclocked` class to avatar container with a stronger glow/animation.

2) Auras:

- If `equippedAura` is set to one of the 3 aura IDs, apply a CSS class on the avatar container or wrapper:
  - `"aura_blue"` → `.aura-blue`
  - `"aura_purple"` → `.aura-purple`
  - `"aura_green"` → `.aura-green`
- Define CSS for these classes to add colored box-shadow or outline glows to the avatar container. The glow should be clearly visible but not overpower the UI.

Make sure:

- The avatar on the Home screen always reflects the currently equipped skin + aura combination (emoji + glow).
- Equipping a new skin or aura in the shop updates the Home screen immediately without needing a refresh.

====================================================
PART 5 – INTEGRATION & POLISH
====================================================

- Keep all existing logic intact (wallet, token-gating, training, result calculations, AI chat, unlimited levels).
- Ensure that Style Credits changes (earn + spend) are always saved to localStorage.
- Style the Cosmetics Shop consistently with the existing dark, glassmorphic theme:
  - Use the same card style, fonts, and colors.
  - Use hover states on buttons and cosmetic cards.
- Do NOT use placeholders or TODOs.
- All prices, names, descriptions, and visuals must be fully implemented and visible to the user as real, usable content.

When finished, the user should be able to:

- See their Style Credits on Home and in the Shop.
- Earn Style Credits from good training runs.
- Open the Cosmetics Shop from Home.
- Buy and equip from 3 avatar skins and 3 auras.
- See the AI avatar change appearance based on equipped cosmetics every time they return to the Home screen.
