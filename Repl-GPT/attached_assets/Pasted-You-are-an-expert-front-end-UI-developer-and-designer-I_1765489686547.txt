You are an expert front-end UI developer and designer.

I already have a working “Train Your AI” quiz game with:
- Home screen
- Training screen
- Result screen
- LocalStorage state (intelligence level, score, etc.)
- Solana wallet integration + token-gated Start button

DO NOT remove or break any existing game logic, state management, or wallet code. Only improve the UI/UX and layout.

Apply the following UI design:

1) Global Layout
- Dark theme with a radial or linear gradient background (e.g. deep blue to dark purple).
- Centered main container with a max width around 480–600px.
- Use a card-style layout:
  - background: rgba(13, 17, 23, 0.96)
  - border-radius: 16px
  - subtle border and drop shadow
- Add a simple top bar:
  - Left: app title “Train Your AI” + small subtitle text.
  - Right: wallet status area:
    - If NOT connected: a “Connect Wallet” button.
    - If connected: a pill showing a green dot + shortened address + disconnect icon/button.
  - Under wallet status, show a single line about token gating:
    - “✅ You have enough $MEME to train” when requirements are met.
    - “⚠️ Need at least 50 $MEME to train” when not.

2) Home Screen
- Inside the main card, create a “Your AI Core” section.
- Left side: AI avatar area:
  - A large emoji inside a glowing circular background.
  - Use the existing intelligenceLevel to pick the emoji:
    - Level 1–3 → 🤖💤 with caption “Very basic model”
    - Level 4–7 → 🤖📚 with caption “Learning well”
    - Level 8+ → 🤖🚀 with caption “Highly trained”
- Right side: a 2×2 stats grid showing:
  - Intelligence Level: L<number>
  - Intelligence Score
  - Total Sessions
  - Best Score (%)
- Below that, add a horizontal “Intelligence Progress” bar that visually represents progress toward the next level (you can derive a percentage from the existing intelligenceScore or just map it to a simple 0–100% scale for now).
- Under the bar, add a compact rules box with the text:
  - “Training Rules:
     • Score ≥ 70% → AI learns and gets smarter
     • 50–69% → AI learns nothing this session
     • < 50% → AI can lose intelligence”
- Show current soft currency balance (e.g. Data Shards if already implemented) as “Data Shards: <value>”.
- At the bottom of the card, add a large primary button:
  - If wallet + token + currency requirements are met: “Start Training Session”.
  - If not, disable it and show a small explanatory message below the button (e.g. “You need 50 Data Shards and 50+ $MEME to train.”).

3) Training Screen
- Title at the top of the card: “Training Session – Level 1”.
- Top row:
  - Left: “Question X of 10”.
  - Right: “Correct so far: N”.
- Show the current question text prominent and readable.
- Render the multiple-choice options as full-width buttons with:
  - Hover state (slight color change and pointer cursor).
  - Selected state (highlighted / outlined).
- When the user clicks an option:
  - Disable all option buttons.
  - Visually mark the selected one.
  - Wait ~700ms before automatically advancing to the next question.
- Near the bottom of the card, show a small reminder:
  - “Remember: score below 50% can make your AI lose intelligence.”

4) Result Screen
- Title: “Session Complete”.
- Show:
  - “You scored X / 10 (Y%)”.
- Add a badge-style outcome label based on the score bands:
  - If score >= 70%:
    - Text: “High-quality training”.
    - Style: green pill.
  - If 50–69%:
    - Text: “Low signal – discarded”.
    - Style: neutral/gray pill.
  - If < 50%:
    - Text: “Noisy data – harmful training”.
    - Style: red pill.
- Show a “Before → After” stats table or side-by-side block with:
  - Intelligence Level: e.g. “L2 → L3”.
  - Intelligence Score: e.g. “120 → 160”.
  - Data Shards balance if applicable: e.g. “430 → 460”.
- Below that, show a short explanation paragraph based on outcome:
  - Success (>=70%):
    “Your AI integrated this session into its core model.”
  - Neutral (50–69%):
    “Answers were too inconsistent. Your AI discarded this data.”
  - Fail (<50%):
    “Too many wrong answers in one batch. Your AI rolled back some intelligence to avoid corrupting its model.”
- Add two buttons at the bottom:
  - Primary: “Train Again” – starts a new session.
  - Secondary (outline): “Back to Home” – goes back to the home screen.
- Slightly tint the background of the result card differently for success (greenish), neutral (default), and fail (reddish) by adding CSS classes like `result--success`, `result--neutral`, and `result--fail`.

5) Styling Details
- Use consistent spacing (padding/margins) and typography across all screens.
- Define CSS variables for the color palette (background, card, accent, text, muted text).
- Implement button hover and active states.
- Make sure the layout works well on mobile (stack avatar and stats vertically and let content wrap).

Do NOT use placeholder text or TODO markers. All UI must be fully implemented and connected to the existing state and logic so the app remains fully playable.
