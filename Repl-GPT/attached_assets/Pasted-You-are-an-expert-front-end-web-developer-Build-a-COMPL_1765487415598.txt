You are an expert front-end web developer.

Build a COMPLETE, FULLY WORKING single-page web app (NO placeholders, NO TODOs, NOTHING stubbed out) that implements this game:

====================================================
GAME CONCEPT – “Train Your AI”
====================================================

The app lets the user “train” a pet AI by answering multiple-choice questions in a training session.

At the end of the session, their score determines:
- Whether the AI gets smarter (intelligence goes up)
- Stays the same (no learning)
- Or gets dumber (intelligence goes down)

All data is stored in localStorage so the user’s AI stats persist between page refreshes.

This must be a complete, playable experience as-is. DO NOT write instructions like “add questions here later” or “replace with real data later”. Implement everything fully.

====================================================
TECH & PROJECT STRUCTURE
====================================================

Use ONLY vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

Create these three files:

1. index.html
2. style.css
3. script.js

Link style.css and script.js from index.html.

The app is a single-page app. Use simple show/hide of different sections for screens (no routing).

====================================================
UI LAYOUT & SCREENS
====================================================

There are three main UI states:

1. HOME SCREEN – AI Overview
2. TRAINING SCREEN – Question Flow
3. RESULT SCREEN – Summary After Session

All screens should be inside a centered main container, with a modern, clean look (dark theme is preferred).

-------------------------
1) HOME SCREEN CONTENT
-------------------------

Visible by default when the app loads.

Components:

- App Title: “Train Your AI”
- A subtitle line explaining the concept:
  “Answer questions to train your AI. High scores make it smarter, bad scores can make it dumber.”
- An AI Avatar area:
  - Show a big emoji representing the AI’s current mood, based on intelligence level:
    - Level 1–3: 🤖💤 with caption “Very basic model”
    - Level 4–7: 🤖📚 with caption “Learning well”
    - Level 8+: 🤖🚀 with caption “Highly trained”
- Display current stats:
  - Intelligence Level: show as integer (starts at 1)
  - Intelligence Score: number (starts at 0)
  - Total Sessions Completed
  - Best Session Score (%)
- A “Start Training Session” button that transitions to the training screen.

Below the button, show a small text block that clearly explains the scoring rules:

- “Score 70% or higher: your AI learns and gets smarter.”
- “Score between 50% and 69%: your AI learns nothing this session.”
- “Score below 50%: your AI can lose intelligence.”

------------------------------
2) TRAINING SCREEN CONTENT
------------------------------

When “Start Training Session” is clicked on the home screen:

- Hide the home screen section.
- Show the training screen section.

Training screen must include:

- A heading: “Training Session – Level 1”
- A progress indicator: “Question X of 10”
- A main card area showing:
  - Question text
  - Multiple choice options (buttons)
- A visible score tracker while answering:
  - For example: “Correct so far: N”

Question behavior:

- Show ONE question at a time.
- The user clicks one of the options to answer.
- After clicking:
  - Lock the answer to prevent changing it.
  - Move automatically to the next question.
- Do NOT show “correct or incorrect” feedback per question in this MVP; feedback comes at the end.

When the user has answered all 10 questions:

- Automatically transition to the RESULT SCREEN.

------------------------------
3) RESULT SCREEN CONTENT
------------------------------

After all questions in a training session are answered, show:

- “Session Complete”
- Show:
  - Questions Correct: e.g. “7 / 10”
  - Score Percentage: e.g. “70%”
- Show the effect on the AI based on score bands:

Game rules:

- If scorePercent >= 70:
  - The AI LEARNS.
  - intelligenceLevel increases by 1 (max never enforced for MVP).
  - intelligenceScore increases by (correctAnswers * 10).
  - Show a success message:
    “Good training! Your AI has learned and grown smarter.”
- If 50 <= scorePercent < 70:
  - The AI learns NOTHING.
  - intelligenceLevel and intelligenceScore do NOT change.
  - Show a neutral message:
    “Not enough signal. Your AI didn’t learn from this session.”
- If scorePercent < 50:
  - The AI LOSES intelligence.
  - intelligenceLevel decreases by 1, but never below 1.
  - intelligenceScore decreases by 20, but never below 0.
  - Show a warning message:
    “Too much noise. Your AI lost intelligence this session.”

Also show “Before → After” stats:

- Intelligence Level: e.g. “L2 → L3” or “L3 → L2”
- Intelligence Score: e.g. “120 → 160”
- Total Sessions: increment by 1
- Update Best Score if this session’s % is higher than previous best.

Buttons on result screen:

- “Back to Home” – takes user back to Home screen and shows updated AI avatar and stats.
- “Train Again” – immediately starts another training session (new run with questions reshuffled).

====================================================
QUESTION DATA – REAL, NON-PLACEHOLDER
====================================================

You MUST implement a real, fully-populated question set.

Requirements:

- Use a JavaScript array of EXACTLY 10 question objects for this MVP.
- Each question must be concrete, meaningful, and non-placeholder.
- Topics can be general knowledge, logic, basic math, and simple concepts.
- Each question object should look like:

  {
    id: 1,
    text: "What does 'CPU' stand for in computing?",
    options: ["Central Processing Unit", "Computer Personal Unit", "Core Processor Utility"],
    correctIndex: 0
  }

- Ensure:
  - Each question has at least 3 options.
  - Exactly one option is correct.
  - correctIndex points to the correct option.

- DO NOT write placeholder-like text such as:
  - “Question goes here”
  - “Option 1 / Option 2 / Option 3”
  - or anything that looks like a template.

The questions must be usable and sensible as-is.

Behavior:

- At the start of each training session, create a working copy of the questions array and randomize their order so that each session can have a different question order.
- For MVP, use all 10 questions in each session (no need to sample/subset).

====================================================
STATE MANAGEMENT & PERSISTENCE
====================================================

Use a single state object in JavaScript to track at least:

- intelligenceLevel (number)
- intelligenceScore (number)
- totalSessions (number)
- bestScorePercent (number)

Initialize default values when no save exists:

- intelligenceLevel: 1
- intelligenceScore: 0
- totalSessions: 0
- bestScorePercent: 0

On app load:

- Try to read from localStorage with a key like "trainYourAIState".
- If no data exists, create the default state.
- Always render the home screen with up-to-date state stats.

On session end (result screen):

- Update this state according to the rules (learning/no learning/losing intelligence).
- Save the state back to localStorage.

Implement helper functions such as:

- loadStateFromStorage()
- saveStateToStorage()
- startTrainingSession()
- showHomeScreen()
- showTrainingScreen()
- showResultScreen()

But make sure ALL of them are fully implemented and working. NO stubs, NO partials.

====================================================
VISUAL DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS
====================================================

- Use CSS to create a clean, centered card-style layout with:
  - A max-width around 480–600px.
  - A subtle drop shadow.
  - Rounded corners.
- Use a dark background for the page (e.g. dark grey / navy).
- Use a contrasting card background for the main container (e.g. slightly lighter dark).
- Buttons should look clickable with hover states (e.g. slight color change, pointer cursor).
- Make the app reasonably responsive for mobile screens:
  - Use responsive font sizes.
  - Let content reflow vertically on narrow screens.

====================================================
CONSTRAINTS / IMPORTANT NOTES
====================================================

- DO NOT generate any placeholder text, placeholder questions, or TODO comments.
- DO NOT leave any function unimplemented.
- When you produce the code, it must be copy-paste runnable in a Replit HTML/CSS/JS project and immediately work as a playable game.
- Everything described above must be implemented as real, working behavior.

Now, write the complete content of:
1) index.html
2) style.css
3) script.js

with all logic, markup, and styling needed for a fully working MVP.
